                    <h1> What does Ant Text do? </h1>
                    <h2> Intelligent Branding Email Templates </h2>
                    <p>Clicking an icon in Microsoft Outlook gives users quick and simple access to the folders to select the required template which is then immediately placed in the new or reply email. Simple but powerful and flexible features allow rich content to be created using pictures, links, video, graphics, tables etc, as well as tagged fields which prompt users to enter variable information like names and dates and instantly updates these throughout the email before it is sent.</p>
                    <p>Because you know the templates are going to be used over and over again, you can spend time making them the best they can be, safe in the knowledge that there are no mistakes in them. But don’t worry, they’re not set in stone, not only can you easily change the template whenever you need to, but the users also have the ability to call them up and make changes to meet individual requirements such as personalizing them. You can even create snippets – small amounts of pre-worded and pre-formatted text to insert into an email the user is creating.</p>
